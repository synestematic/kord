# kord
kord is a python framework that provides programmers with a simple api for the creation of music-based applications. While it's mainly intended for theoretical purposes, some of it's modules contain functionality specifically tailored for dealing with plucked-string instruments.

## installation

The only dependency for `kord` is the package `bestia`, my own library for creating command-line applications. Both can be automatically installed using pip:

```
$  python3 -m pip install kord
```

The fretboard application component of the framework can also be run directly in a containerized form. This requires you to install 0 dependencies on your system besides docker. 

```
$  docker run -t synestematic/kord  C --scale major
```

Scroll to the bottom of the README for more information on the fretboard application.


# api reference:

Please only expect to understand the following documentation if you have an above basic understanding of music theory. With that said, let's dive into the first module:


## kord.notes

### class MusicNote:

MusicNote instances are the building blocks of the framework and have 3 main attributes:

```
* chr: str    ('C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B')
* alt: str    ('bb', 'b', '', '#', '##')
* oct: int    (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
```

You can set these values when creating an instance and only the `chr` argument is required. Arguments `alt` and `oct` will default to `''` and `3` respectively. These are __positional__ arguments, not keyword arguments so keep that in mind when creating your objects.

```
>>> from kord.notes import MusicNote
>>> e3, f3 = MusicNote('e'), MusicNote('f')
>>> e3, f3
(E³, F³) 
>>> MusicNote('G', 'b')
G♭³
>>> MusicNote('C', 9)
C⁹
>>> MusicNote('B', 'b', 7)
B♭⁷
>>> MusicNote('C', '#', 0)
C♯⁰
```

Notes with double alterations are supported but Notes with triple or more alterations will raise an exception:

```
>>> MusicNote('A', 'bb', 1)
A𝄫¹
>>> MusicNote('F', '##', 1)
F𝄪¹
>>> MusicNote('G', '###')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ...
kord.errors.InvalidAlteration: ###
```

Similarly, the maximum octave value currently supported is 9.

```
>>> MusicNote('D', 10)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ...
kord.errors.InvalidOctave: 10
```

### Comparing MusicNote objects:
 
The ```-   < >   <= >=   == !=   >>   ** ```  operators allow computation of semitone intervals between MusicNote instances and give insight into their enharmonic relationships. Let's take a quick look at each operator separately:

#### - operator

The substraction operator lets you compute the difference in semitones between two notes:

```
>>> f3 - e3
1
>>> MusicNote('a', 'b', 2) - MusicNote('g', '#', 2)
0
>>> MusicNote('a', 8) - MusicNote('c', 4)
57
>>> MusicNote('a', 8) - MusicNote('c', '##', 4)
55
```


####  < >   <= >=   == !=  operators

Comparison operators return boolean values based *exclusively* on the interval between the 2 objects. 

```
>>> f3 > e3
True
>>> f3 >= e3
True
```

While the concept is seemingly straightforward, special attention needs to be taken when using `== !=` with enharmonic notes.

```
>>> n1 = MusicNote('F', '#', 5)
>>> n2 = MusicNote('G', 'b', 5)
>>> n1, n2
(F♯⁵, G♭⁵)
>>> n1 == n2
True
```

The notes F♯⁵ and G♭⁵ are NOT the same but since their interval is a unison, the `==` comparison evaluates True. This might seem a bit counter-intuitive at first but you can still check for exact note matches with the use of 2 other operators.

#### >> ** operators

The power and right-shift operators allow you to compare Notes for equality based not on their intervals, but on their intrinsic `chr`, `alt`, `oct` properties. The strictest operator `>>` compares all 3 attributes for equality while the looser `**` ignores `oct`: 

```
>>> ab1, ab5 = MusicNote('A', 'b', 1),  MusicNote('A', 'b', 5)
>>> ab1 == ab5
False
>>> ab1 ** ab5
True
```

Notice `**` evaluates True since both instances are A flat notes, even when there is a wide interval between them.

```
>>> ab1 >> ab5
False
>>> ab1.oct = 5
>>> ab1 >> ab5
True
```

For the `>>` operator to evaluate True, the octaves of the notes must match as well.

## kord.keys


### class MusicKey:

Think of MusicKey objects as generators of MusicNote objects. You can define a new class which inherits MusicKey and use any theoretical arrangement of `intervals` from the root note in order to create chords, scales, modes, etc. You can further taylor these child classes by restricting `degrees` to specific values, this is very useful for creating chords.

These are a couple of pre-defined examples to give you an idea of how it works:

```
class ChromaticScale(MusicKey):
    intervals = (
        UNISON,
        MINOR_SECOND,
        MAJOR_SECOND,
        MINOR_THIRD,
        MAJOR_THIRD,
        PERFECT_FOURTH,
        AUGMENTED_FOURTH,
        PERFECT_FIFTH,
        MINOR_SIXTH,
        MAJOR_SIXTH,
        MINOR_SEVENTH,
        MAJOR_SEVENTH,
    )

class MajorScale(MusicKey):
    intervals = (
        UNISON,
        MAJOR_SECOND,
        MAJOR_THIRD,
        PERFECT_FOURTH,
        PERFECT_FIFTH,
        MAJOR_SIXTH,
        MAJOR_SEVENTH,
    )
    
class MajorPentatonicScale(MajorScale):
    degrees = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6)

class MajorTriad(MajorScale):
    degrees = (1, 3, 5)
```

Bare in mind that MusicKey objects are initialized with `chr` and `alt` attributes, `oct` values are not taken into consideration. These allows us to simply unpack MusicNote objects in order to create MusicKey instances based off of them. Once we have a MusicKey object, we can access it's single degrees using list index notation:

```
>>> from kord.keys import ChromaticScale
>>> c = MusicNote('C')
>>> c_chromatic_scale = ChromaticScale(*c)
>>> c_chromatic_scale[2]
C♯⁰
>>> c_chromatic_scale[12]
B⁰
```

### MusicKey.spell()

Retrieving individual degrees is good, but it is perhaps more interesting to look at a more dynamic way of getting notes out of our MusicKey instances. The `spell()` method provides such an interface for generating MusicNote instances on the fly. Let's take a look at a couple of examples and the several arguments that we can use when calling this method:

```
>>> for note in c_chromatic_scale.spell():
...     print(note, end=' ')
...
C⁰ C♯⁰ D⁰ D♯⁰ E⁰ F⁰ F♯⁰ G⁰ G♯⁰ A⁰ A♯⁰ B⁰ C¹ >>> 
```

As seen above the method will generate the first octave of degrees of the object when called without arguments.

The `note_count` argument is an `int` and it allows us to set a specific amount of notes to retrieve:

```
>>> from kord.keys import MinorScale
>>> a_minor_scale = MinorScale('A')
>>> for note in a_minor_scale.spell(note_count=4):
...     print(note, end=' ')
...
A⁰ B⁰ C¹ D¹ >>> 
```

Be careful, ask for too many notes and kord will throw and Exception when `oct` 9 has been exceeded.

The `yield_all` argument is a `bool` that will make the method yield not just `MusicNote` instances, but also `None` objects for every non-diatonic semitone found:

```
>>> for note in a_minor_scale.spell(note_count=4, yield_all=True):
...     print(note, end=' ')
...
A⁰ None B⁰ C¹ None D¹ >>> 
```


The `start_note` argument is a `MusicNote` object that can be used to start getting notes only after a specific note has been found. This can be done even if the note is not diatonic to the scale:

```
>>> Db1 = MusicNote('D', 'b', 1)
>>> for note in a_minor_scale.spell(note_count=4, yield_all=True, start_note=Db1):
...     print(note, end=' ')
...
None D¹ None E¹ F¹ None G¹ >>> 
```



## fretboard tool

A sample application `fretboard.py` comes built-in with `kord` and gives some insight into the possibilities of the framework. It displays a representation of your instrument's fretboard, tuned to your liking along with note patterns for any given mode (scale/chord) for any given root note. 

If you installed via pip (as opposed to cloning this repo) installation path will depend on your system, it's usually something like `/usr/local/fretboard` or `~/.local/fretboard`. You will also find a `tunings` directory with some pre-defined instrument tunings in the form of .json files. Feel free to modify them or add your own and they should immediately become available to the run-time.

```
$  python3 fretboard.py --help
usage: fretboard.py [-h] [-d] [-s  | -c ] [-i] [-t] [-f] [-v] root

<<< Fretboard visualizer sample tool for the kord music framework >>>

positional arguments:
  root                select key ROOT note

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -d, --degrees       show degree numbers instead of note pitches
  -s , --scale        major, minor, melodic_minor, harmonic_minor, major_pentatonic, minor_pentatonic,
                      ionian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, dorian, phrygian, locrian, chromatic
  -c , --chord        maj, min, aug, dim, maj7, min7, 7, dim7, min7dim5, maj9, min9, 9
  -i , --instrument   banjo, guitar, pedal, bass, ukulele
  -t , --tuning       check .json files for available options
  -f , --frets        1, 2, .., 36
  -v , --verbosity    0, 1, 2
```

The only required parameter is the `root` note. 

The `--scale` and `--chord` options let you choose which note pattern to display for the selected root. They are mutually exclusive and the default value is `--chord maj` when left blank.

The `--instrument` and `--tuning` options refer to the json files you will find in the tunings directory. Default values are `--instrument guitar   --tuning standard`.

The `--frets` option let's you choose how many frets to visualize, maximum value is 36. Default value will fill your terminal screen.

The `--verbosity` option let's you choose how much information to see on-screen from 0 to 2. Default value is 1.

The `--degrees` option let's you display degree numbers instead of notes. Default value is false.
